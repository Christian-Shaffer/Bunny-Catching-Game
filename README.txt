This game was made using the Pygame module. 

I'm still learning, but it seems like after you download the zip folder and extract this, you need to get rid of the main folder and just have all the files sitting in the main directory. That's how I've gotten it to work. 

Make sure you have Python installed and the Pygame module. Run the game from the BunnyCatcher.py file. 

Enjoy!
